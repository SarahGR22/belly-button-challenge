Challenge 14

Belly Button Biodiversity dataset catalogs human navels. The dataset informs that a small handful of microbial species called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. Various charts were created to build on from the dataset and view the instances. 

From this challenge there was insight provided by a tutor and from the learning assistant.
